Student Innovation (Language related application)
Problem Description and statistical Data
This is student innovation where we’ll make an application based on one of the toughest languages Telugu. Many people who have their mother tongue “Telugu” struggle to read Telugu. There are 2 Telugu speaking states “Andhra Pradesh” and “Telangana” where about 90% of them speak Telugu and Telugu is fourth most spoken language in India. So, it is much more important to speak Telugu.
